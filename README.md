This project, known as Spyse, composes scores of any length
by combining variations of existing segments in a random order.
The resulting composition is then exported to sheet music, midi, and audio files.

The lower octave consists of a series of random rows from a twelve tone matrix.
The upper octave consists of randomly ordered, pre-composed segments
based on the unordered set of pitch classes `{0, 2, 4}`, which is part of the whole tone scale.

This project combines chance music with twelve tone matrices and some set theory.

Overall, the music is very chaotic, without any discernible pattern.
However after listening to the music for a short while, it begins to sound monotonous.

The purpose of this project was to explore randomness through computer generated music.
As a result, the music is not designed to be human playable, nor is it intended to sound pleasing.
